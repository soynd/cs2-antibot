# cs2-botdb/slower
WINDOWS/LINUX


a macro app thats allows players to stop the bots from walking 


How is works???

1.some auto farm cheats has a spectator detection thats detects if someone spectates them if yes the bot (player) stops moving and shooting

2.using pynput and other tools thats triggers left click,scroll

3.IM NOT SURE IF ITS DETECTED BY VAC BUT I RECOMEND TO USE ANOTHER ACCOUNT 

4.in future i have plans to add a db thats automaticly reports players (bots) 

5.plz if u have old laptop run this app
